Fundamentally, science is the pursuit of knowledge, ideally fueled by an overpowering inquisitive desire to know more about the world around you. Hopefully if your reading this you already know that. But what you may not yet appreciate is the role and power of processing data to answer your questions. Data is facts, statistics, and knowledge collected together for reference, analysis, and reasoning or calculation that is collected together to represent a system we have an interest in learning more about. Data is fundamental to the progression of knowledge, and conducting the scientific process. The modern age has brought with it enormous advancements in technology, and massive amounts of data. For us, most data is the product of electrical impulses acting upon sensors which measure some aspect of the system. This may be the inductance of electricity within a scales weigh bars, the vector force along the axis of an accelerometer, the time taken for a GPS signal to reach the receiver from the satellite, or the magnitude of light reflected onto a cameras photo diode. Other data may include counts of things existing within a certain defined space at a defined temporal interval and recorded in a notebook. But even these data are then converted to some electronic format with all possible haste. All data processing should begin with an appreciation for how various sensors function, the capability of the observer, and other limitations. Understanding these will help inform you the specific aspect of the system (animal body-weight, greenness, position, number of animals etc.) the sensor (or human) is measuring. Because we live in a dynamic world, these data points captured independently are only somewhat informative. Real scientific power comes by understanding these measurements relative to other data collected in the same system along some interval. This is the foundation of mathematics, specifically algebra and calculus. However, because we live in a dynamic world, perfectly modeling nature is impossible for all intents and purposes. Thus, variation comes into play and we are tasked with assessing the relative variation we observe in the system and separating it from the affect we are exploring. This is known as probability. Statistics is the merger of theoretical mathematics with applied systems in the real world, and allows us to report results tempered by quantified uncertainty. Simply put: Statistics is the science of Learning from Data. My goal of this coursework and textbook are for students to learn valuable critical thinking and problem solving skills. Students should learn to be confident in their problem solving skills and ability to continue learning. Students should exit the course with the ability to identify and carefully define problems, develop clear objectives, identify methods to solve those problems, clearly support the results they find with rational logic, and clearly communicate what you have done and learned in the context of the current body of knowledge to the greater world.

R is a full fledged computer language with sophisticated data structures. It is created by statisticians as an interactive environment for data analysis, allowing for both interacting with data in an exploratory maneer while maintaining the critical aspects of reproducibility. These scripts serve as a permanent record for analysis you have performed, allowing for quick re-execution at any moment or the incorporation of new data. If you are patient, you will find the unequaled attractiveness and power of R for both data analysis and visualization. Attractive features of R include: Free and open source Runs on all major platforms, including Windows, MacOS, LINUX Script sharing is easy across platforms Large and active community of users, including plethura of new libraries implementing the latest methods Easy to publish and distribute new methods. 2.1.2 Why not use R? Using R is strongly recommended in this class. It is a powerful tool that can manage some of the most taxing of statistical methods, is free, and many times more capable than software that costs many thousands of dollars per user license. It is used extensively by both academia and industry, including tech giants like Amazon and Google. While it is possible to do any of these things in programs like SAS, JMP, SPSS, or even Excel, they are not free, they can be clunky to use, and you will have to figure it out on your own as I haven’t used those softwares in many years. Thus, I would very much encourage you to give R a shot. 2.2 Using R 2.2.1 Installing R To use R, follow the following steps. Go to Program R’s website (https://www.r-project.org) Select the Download R link, select your prefered CRAN mirror (I typically pick Iowa State, here is a link directly to that mirror https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/) Select the version for your machine (Windows, Mac etc.) Open the install engine and follow the steps. Opening R should show you the R console, which looks something like this: This is powerful, but likely not as approachable as you would like. To address this, I strongly recommend using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which serves to put all of the best features of a programming languange at the forefront. For R, there are many, includinge VSCode, Jupyter Notebooks, and RStudio. I recommend RStudio, and will be using it throughout the course. 1. Go to the link for RStudio (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) and download the appropriate Rstudio for your computer. 2. Run the install engine, which should go find your installation of R. !! You must install R first, then RStudio !! 2.2.2 Navigating R Studio Upon opening R studio, you should see an interface that looks something like this. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;images/rstudio.png&quot;) Figure 2.1: RStudio The left paine shows the R console. The top right pane includes tabs showing the objects, datasets, functions and values loaded in the R environment. Other tabs include showing the history of executed code during the current session, connections to servers, GIT, and other tabs loaded as needed depending on what addons you have. The bottom right pain includes tabs showing files in the current folder for the current R project, plots built from executed code, packages and ability to install other packages, Veiwer for markdown files (such as this one), and presentations. When you start or open an R script, it will add a 4th pane in the the top left where .R and .rmd files can be edited. Note that this is the default arrangement, and your appearance is customization as you see fit. 2.2.3 Installing packages Now that you have R installed, you have access to basic functions and that come with the program. However, the power of R comes from the collaborative nature of the R community, and you will find that there are packages which you use all the time. Here is how to download and install packages using a set of packages that I find extremely useful. These packages are documented and maintained on R’s repository, meaning they have gone through rigourous checks to ensure they work with the current versions of R, and have published documentation for their methods and functions. # install.packages(&quot;data.table&quot;) # installs one package at a time. # or you can install a bunch of packages at one time # Libraries to install packages &lt;- c(&quot;data.table&quot;, &quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;MCMCvis&quot;, &quot;ggExtra&quot;, &quot;devtools&quot;)# List of packages to check/install # Function to check and install packages install_if_missing = function(pkg) { #Create function command if (!require(pkg, character.only = TRUE)) { # list of functions to iterate over install.packages(pkg, dependencies = TRUE) # install packages command for each package in list library(pkg, character.only = TRUE) # Load each package in the list using the library function } else { cat(paste(&quot;Package&quot;, pkg, &quot;is already installed.\\n&quot;)) # If package is installed already skip and report } } # Apply the function to each package in the list lapply(packages, install_if_missing) # Run install packages command created above ## Loading required package: data.table ## Package data.table is already installed. ## Loading required package: tidyverse ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ── ## ✔ dplyr 1.1.4 ✔ readr 2.1.5 ## ✔ forcats 1.0.0 ✔ stringr 1.5.1 ## ✔ ggplot2 3.5.2 ✔ tibble 3.2.1 ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.4 ✔ tidyr 1.3.1 ## ✔ purrr 1.0.4 ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::between() masks data.table::between() ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::first() masks data.table::first() ## ✖ lubridate::hour() masks data.table::hour() ## ✖ lubridate::isoweek() masks data.table::isoweek() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() ## ✖ dplyr::last() masks data.table::last() ## ✖ lubridate::mday() masks data.table::mday() ## ✖ lubridate::minute() masks data.table::minute() ## ✖ lubridate::month() masks data.table::month() ## ✖ lubridate::quarter() masks data.table::quarter() ## ✖ lubridate::second() masks data.table::second() ## ✖ purrr::transpose() masks data.table::transpose() ## ✖ lubridate::wday() masks data.table::wday() ## ✖ lubridate::week() masks data.table::week() ## ✖ lubridate::yday() masks data.table::yday() ## ✖ lubridate::year() masks data.table::year() ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors ## Package tidyverse is already installed. ## Loading required package: MCMCvis ## Package MCMCvis is already installed. ## Loading required package: ggExtra ## Package ggExtra is already installed. ## Loading required package: devtools ## Loading required package: usethis ## Package devtools is already installed. ## [[1]] ## NULL ## ## [[2]] ## NULL ## ## [[3]] ## NULL ## ## [[4]] ## NULL ## ## [[5]] ## NULL However, the beauty of R is that anyone can publish a package to serve there purposes, encapsulate their methods, or share their ideas. And that is what I have done to facilitate sharing data within this course. Please load the package below to install the example datasets which will be used throughout this course. I may add datasets as we go, and will tell you if you need to update to the most current version of this package. If so, simply rerun the code below in your R console. I built the following package, and it is available on my github in the qthink repository. devtools::install_github(&quot;irap93/qthink&quot;) # install a package from github using hte devtools package ## Using GitHub PAT from the git credential store. ## Skipping install of &#39;qthink&#39; from a github remote, the SHA1 (74bb766d) has not changed since last install. ## Use `force = TRUE` to force installation Now, we need to load our packages. Loading packages is accomplished through the library() command in your r console or rscript. library(qthink) # laod packages one by one using the &quot;library&quot; command library(data.table) library(tidyverse) Or, you can load them all at once like this using a for loop, which cycles through each package, checks if its installed and loaded packages &lt;- c(&quot;data.table&quot;, &#39;qthink&#39;,&#39;tidyverse&#39;)# List of packages to check/install # Load each package, install if missing using a loop for (pkg in packages) { if (!requireNamespace(pkg, quietly = TRUE)) { install.packages(pkg) } library(pkg, character.only = TRUE) } 2.2.4 Loading data into the R environment There are numerous ways to load data into R using a number of different libraries. For this lesson, we will be using the data in qthink library to illustrate how to save data and reload it using base R. # load the heifer dataset from the qthink package data(&quot;heifer&quot;) # Load the heifer data from the qthink package head(heifer) # Look at the heifer data # Save it to your workspace, change out the file path name to reflect your computer write.csv(heifer, file = &#39;/Users/iraparsons/Documents/AS791_FundQuantThink/Data/heifer.csv&#39;) # Save the data to your machine Now go look in your folder to see if a csv file was saved. Open it up and look at it. Now lets reload it into the workspace. You can load csv files you create from excel workbooks to load your personal data into R in the same fashion. heifer1 = read.csv(file = &#39;/Users/iraparsons/Documents/AS791_FundQuantThink/Data/heifer.csv&#39;) # Example of how to read the file back into Did a new data file named heifer1 show up in your R environmnent? If so, you have been sucessfull. Now, lets explore the data a bit. 2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis and Graphics If you know about your data, as in you collected it for your research project, you probably already know what everything represents. But in this case, we need to look at the description of the data. I saved metadata describing this dataset in the package, which we can see by running the following queries. help(heifer) # Look at the help and documentation material for the heifer data help(&quot;bodyweight&quot;) # Look at the help and documentation material for the bodyweight data set. The study description should appear in the lower right pane under the ‘help’ tab. When approaching a data set, it is important to do due diligence and ensure that a complete understanding of the data is achieved before further analysis or publication is undertaken. This can be achieved in a number of ways, which will be enumerated below. As with any analysis, an understanding of the studies experimental design is critical to understanding what values may be expected within the data sheet, and will lend insight into what potential analysis may be conducted. When opening a data set, it is important to have an understanding of what to expect. This includes such things as the study design and description, and the meta-data associated with the data sheets. Meta data, at the very least, should include descriptions of the column names, and indicate the type of data you might expect to be within. It may also include information concerning individual observations, such as animals that died or were pulled from the study, why they might have been pulled, and other factors that should be considered when analyzing the data. File and column names should be kept as simple, yet descriptive, as possible. Use well known naming conventions, and avoid the use of spaces, instead using underscores or dots, though dots should be avoided as they are action symbols in python. You will quickly understand the value of having well conceived naming conventions for things you will type a lot, such as the names of columns and data frames. As we go through the class, you will likely notice some of the naming conventions that I have adopted. Feel free to use and adopt these for you own use. You will undoubtedly find a specific style which better suits your specific fancy and needs, but I think it is important that you do adopt a style for your own sanity. 2.3.1 Summary Statistics We might first want to know some basic information about the dataframe we’ve loaded. How many rows are in the dataframe by running nrow(heifer) Second, it might be important to know what our column names are names(heifer) Second, we might be interested in what animals are in the dataframe, which we can see by running unique(heifer$VID) When approaching a dataset, it is important to understand what we have. Now that we know how the data was collected, we need to consider the data structure. str(heifer) # check the structure of the dataset ## spc_tbl_ [77 × 21] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ VID : num [1:77] 248 249 276 298 322 346 364 367 453 472 ... ## $ Pen : num [1:77] 8 8 6 6 8 6 5 7 6 5 ... ## $ CreepTrt : chr [1:77] &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;B&quot; ... ## $ WeanTrt : chr [1:77] &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; ... ## $ D_42_BW : num [1:77] 261 210 177 198 198 ... ## $ Creep_Gain : num [1:77] 34.5 23.1 29 30.8 34.5 ... ## $ Shipping_Loss : num [1:77] -5.44 -4.54 -3.63 -6.8 -3.63 ... ## $ Day56_InitialBW: num [1:77] 287 223 200 218 233 ... ## $ Day56_ADG : num [1:77] 1.218 0.946 1.147 1.064 1.298 ... ## $ Day56_MMBW : num [1:77] 1.218 0.946 1.147 1.064 1.298 ... ## $ Day56_DMI : num [1:77] 6.97 6.54 6.24 6.29 7.29 ... ## $ Day56_Residual : num [1:77] -0.118 0.266 0.266 -0.149 0.376 ... ## $ D_1_EV : num [1:77] 0.44 0.389 0.365 0.555 0.662 0.572 0.318 0.362 0.562 0.769 ... ## $ AVE_TTB : num [1:77] 36.2 23.3 69.8 84.1 51.5 ... ## $ BVFREQ : num [1:77] 81 91.4 76.6 85.7 59.2 ... ## $ BVDUR : num [1:77] 6451 7143 7471 5156 8871 ... ## $ BVFREQsd : num [1:77] 81 91.4 76.6 85.7 59.2 ... ## $ BVDURsd : num [1:77] 6451 7143 7471 5156 8871 ... ## $ uDMI : num [1:77] 7.21 7.11 6.71 6.73 7.57 ... ## $ sdDMI : num [1:77] 2.9 2.39 2.35 2.18 2.65 ... ## $ cvDMI : num [1:77] 0.403 0.336 0.351 0.323 0.349 ... ## - attr(*, &quot;spec&quot;)= ## .. cols( ## ..

DO NOT PUT PERIODS IN FOR MISSING DATA!! This is not only extremely annoying, it messes with Rs ability to automatically categorize variables as numeric, character, integer, etc. Just leave those cells blank when entering the data. This is a convention that is leftover from programs such as SAS. However, should you get such a datasheet, you can write a replace function to put NAs in the place of the periods, but it is extremely annoying to have to do so. Next, lets graphically look at our data. 2.3.2 Exploratory Graphics Histograms Histograms are extremely useful, as they show the number of animals that fit in each area of the group. hist(heifer$D_42_BW) # histogram of the first bodyweight Or we can use the code to create multiple plots in the same graphic to look at everything at once. Here its easier to use the proportion so everything scales. vars = c(&#39;D_42_BW&#39;,&#39;Creep_Gain&#39;,&#39;Shipping_Loss&#39;,&#39;Day56_InitialBW&#39;,&#39;Day56_ADG&#39;,&#39;Day56_MMBW&#39;,&#39;Day56_DMI&#39;,&#39;Day56_Residual&#39;,&#39;D_1_EV&#39;, &#39;AVE_TTB&#39;,&#39;BVFREQ&#39;,&#39;BVDUR&#39;,&#39;BVFREQsd&#39;,&#39;BVDURsd&#39;,&#39;uDMI&#39;,&#39;sdDMI&#39;,&#39;cvDMI&#39;) # List of variables we want histograms of for (v in vars) { # Set up a for loop to make a histogram of each variable (v) in the list of variables (vars) hist(heifer[[v]], # create a histogram (hist) of each variable in data (heifer) and the variable in the list [[v]] probability = T, # actual counts &quot;F&quot; vs. Proportions &quot;T&quot; main = paste(&quot;Histogram of&quot;,v), # Past the text &quot;Histogram of&quot; with the variable name xlab = v) # Label x axis with variable name lines(density(heifer[[v]])) # Add lines of the density distribution &quot;density(heifer[[v]])&quot; } 2.4 Relationships among covariates “There are no routine statistical questions, only questionable statistical routines.” – Sir David Cox “Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.” – John Tukey Part of the creative process is understanding relationships among covariates within a dataset. Breaking down the data by some categorical variable is the next step in zooming into our dataset. Box and whisker plots, or their modern cousins violin plots, give a compact visual summary of the datasets distributions and can be broken out by categorical variables. They give a visual representation of 5 key variables Minimum: The smallest value excluding outliers First quartile: the 25th percentile Median (Q2): the middle value of the data Third quartile: the 75th percentile Maximum: The largest value of hte data exlcuding outliers It also shows other information such as: Interquartile range (IQR): spread between Q1 and Q3 Whiskers: Indicate variability outside the middle 50% of the data Outliers: Plotted individual points beyond the whiskers This allows you to evaluate the central tendency, spread, and skewness of the dataset, and is useful for comparing results across groups. boxplot(heifer$D_42_BW ~ heifer$WeanTrt) # plot boxplot with continuous variable &quot;D_42_BW&quot; relative to the categorical variable &quot;WeanTrt&quot; on the x axis ggplot(data = heifer, aes(x=WeanTrt, y = D_42_BW, fill = WeanTrt))+ # initiate ggplot,specify data, and define x and y variables geom_violin(draw_quantiles = T)+ # direct ggplot to create a violin plot # geom_boxplot(fill = &#39;NA&#39;) # Direct ggplot to make a box plot # stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = &#39;crossbar&#39;)+ # use stat_summary to draw a crossbar on the plot geom_point(position = &#39;jitter&#39;)+ # Point points on the graph labs(x = &#39;Weaning Treatment&#39;, # X label y = &#39;Bodyweight Day -42, Kg&#39;) # Y label I personally like violin plots because it shows both the distribution of the data. However, it doesn’t include some of the other parameters like mean and standard error that a box plot does. There are ways of adding those afterwards. But they both serve a purpose and you take your pick. However, as you note this is not a simple preweaning treatment. Heifers were also fed different treatments post weaning, in a 2x2 crossover factorial design. So how do we look at these affects? Well, with a bit more data wrangling, we can. For simplicities sake, we will create a new column including the combination of both the pre and post weaning treatments. heifer$pptrt = paste0(heifer$CreepTrt, &#39;_&#39;, heifer$WeanTrt) # Create a new variable column in data combining pre and post weaning treatments head(heifer) # Look at the first 10 lines of the data ## # A tibble: 6 × 22 ## VID Pen CreepTrt WeanTrt D_42_BW Creep_Gain Shipping_Loss Day56_InitialBW ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 248 8 A A 261. 34.5 -5.44 287. ## 2 249 8 A A 210. 23.1 -4.54 223. ## 3 276 6 B A 177. 29.0 -3.63 200. ## 4 298 6 B A 198. 30.8 -6.80 218. ## 5 322 8 A A 198. 34.5 -3.63 233. ## 6 346 6 B A 189. 13.6 -2.27 185. ## # ℹ 14 more variables: Day56_ADG &lt;dbl&gt;, Day56_MMBW &lt;dbl&gt;, Day56_DMI &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # Day56_Residual &lt;dbl&gt;, D_1_EV &lt;dbl&gt;, AVE_TTB &lt;dbl&gt;, BVFREQ &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # BVDUR &lt;dbl&gt;, BVFREQsd &lt;dbl&gt;, BVDURsd &lt;dbl&gt;, uDMI &lt;dbl&gt;, sdDMI &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # cvDMI &lt;dbl&gt;, pptrt &lt;chr&gt; There. Now you should have a column featuring the combination of the pre and post weaning treatments, separated by an underscore. Lets make new plots comparing all of the variables for each treatment vars = c(&#39;D_42_BW&#39;,&#39;Creep_Gain&#39;,&#39;Shipping_Loss&#39;,&#39;Day56_InitialBW&#39;,&#39;Day56_ADG&#39;,&#39;Day56_MMBW&#39;,&#39;Day56_DMI&#39;,&#39;Day56_Residual&#39;,&#39;D_1_EV&#39;, &#39;AVE_TTB&#39;,&#39;BVFREQ&#39;,&#39;BVDUR&#39;,&#39;BVFREQsd&#39;,&#39;BVDURsd&#39;,&#39;uDMI&#39;,&#39;sdDMI&#39;,&#39;cvDMI&#39;) # List of variables to plot trt_colors = c(&quot;A_A&quot; = &quot;#0C2340&quot;, &quot;B_A&quot; = &quot;#003087&quot;, &quot;A_B&quot; = &#39;#C99700&#39;, &quot;B_B&quot;=&#39;#F1EB9C&#39;) # Make a vector defining colors of each treatment for (v in vars) { # for loop to iterate over each variable v in the list vars boxplot(heifer[[v]]~heifer$pptrt, # Make a boxplot main = paste(&quot;Boxplot of&quot;,v), # title boxplot ylab = v, # label y axis xlab = &#39;Treatment&#39;, # label x axis col = trt_colors[levels(factor(heifer$pptrt))]) # assign colors from list trt_colors } 2.4.1 Scatter plots Scatter plots are another great way of looking for patterns in the data relative to another variable.

Cool. What do we notice about the pattern, and what can we intuite about that from the data? Lets look at more linear relationship. ggplot(data = bw.l, aes(x=as.numeric(Day),y=BW, color = factor(VID)))+ geom_smooth() # ggsmooth plot. Draws a best fit line according to method specified. defaults to smoothing splines ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39; ## Warning: Removed 78 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range ## (`stat_smooth()`). ggplot(data = bw.l, aes(x=as.numeric(Day),y=BW, color = factor(VID)))+ geom_smooth(method = &#39;lm&#39;) # ggsmooth plot. Specified using a linear line. ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39; ## Warning: Removed 78 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range ## (`stat_smooth()`). Now what do we notice? R is using a function called smoothing splines to minimize the residual distance between the line and each observed weight. We will cover residuals more when we talk about linear models. But lets plot one more plot, this time comparing treatments. ggplot(data = bw.l, aes(x=as.numeric(Day),y=BW, color = paste(CreepTrt,WeanTrt)))+ geom_smooth() ## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39; ## Warning: Removed 78 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range ## (`stat_smooth()`). ggplot(data = bw.l, aes(x=as.numeric(Day),y=BW, color = paste(CreepTrt,WeanTrt)))+ geom_smooth(method = &#39;lm&#39;) ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39; ## Warning: Removed 78 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range ## (`stat_smooth()`). What do we notice about these graphs? What might we learn from these that was not apparent in the heifer data sheet? 2.5 Deterministic functions 2.5.1 Why deterministic functions Deterministic functions tie patterns to your data. These may be as simple as phenomenalogical descriptions of the data that describe the pattern as accurately as possible. Or they may be the explicit representation of some biological or ecological theory that we wish to test. Either way, they allow us to move forward from the purely explanatory observations of data explored above. Use functions with meaningfull parameters whenever possible, as this increases both the interpretability of the model. You may define your own functions, or, and this is more likely, apply a mathematical function that someone else has previously defined. Different functions describe different responses and should be selected based upon both the hypothesis you are testing, variables you have collected, and response you are attempting to achieve. Deterministic functions are repeatable, where \\(f(x)\\) always gives the same results for \\(x\\) without randomness or other stochastic functions which allows the function’s rules to completely determine its output. Deterministic functions are by their nature, cause and effect. You will most likely use predefined deterministic functions to develop and test your hypothesis. Below are several examples of deterministic functions that are found and used in the literature. Run the code in your R interface and see if you get the same results. Play with the parameters and see how that effects the shape of the resulting data. Perhaps consider creating other plots that describe the data created by each of these functions. All of statistics is centered around describing the fit of data to a model. That data model may be simple or complex, but it is fundamentally seeking to understand a system or the effect of a treatment or thing First order quadratic model R provides the power to consider unique equations and easily see how they describe the relationships between variables. Understanding what the parameters of various functions mean is critical to allow you to estimate what values may take on when looking at the data. However, there is also value in seeing how to create a controlled system that follows a specified pattern, and then assess how consistently the chosen models explain the data. Consider the linear model, which takes the form of \\(y=\\beta_{o} + \\beta_1x + \\epsilon\\); where \\(y\\) is the dependent variable \\(\\beta_o\\) is the intercept on the Y axis, \\(\\beta_1\\) is the slope of the \\(x\\) parameter along the X axis, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error for each ith data point along the regression line. x = seq(1,12, 1) # Independent X parameter placed on the X axis b0 = 10 # Specify the Y intercept b1 = 3 # Specify the B1 coefficient i.e. the slope y = b0 + b1*x # integrateing the linear model par(mfrow = c(1,3)) # used for base graphing functions. Sets up a plot figure with 1 ro and 3 columns for 3 plots hist(x) # Histogram of x hist(y) # Histogram of y { plot(x,y, # x and y variables for scatter plot ylim = c(0,max(y)), # manually set the range of y main = expression(y == beta0 + beta*1*x + epsilon)) # use the &quot;expression&quot; function to write the mathematical function for a linear equation abline(lm(y~x), col = &#39;blue&#39;) # add a line according to the function lm, colored blue } par(mfrow = c(1,1)) # reset graphics parameter to 1x1 i.e. one plot per figure window. summary(lm(y~x)) # return the summary of the linear function. lm function is nested inside the summary function. ## Warning in summary.lm(lm(y ~ x)): essentially perfect fit: summary may be ## unreliable ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ x) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -3.727e-15 -1.897e-15 -5.724e-16 8.545e-16 7.789e-15 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Next, we will plot the same data, except adding in an element of expected randomness due to some error associated with measuring the data. First order exponential A first exponential function takes on the characteristics of \\(ae^{bx}\\) where \\(a\\) is the initial scaling factor, \\(e\\) represents euler’s number (-2.718), \\(b\\) represents the rate parameter, where positive represents exponential growth, and negative represents exponential decay, and x represents the independent variable, often time, but may be another variable. Positive exponential a = 1 # alpha of the equation b = 1 # beta of the equation x = seq(0,10,length = 100) # x sequence to integrate over y = a*exp(b*x) # calculate the integral of y for each xi plot.new() # create a new plot { plot(x,y, type = &#39;b&#39;, main = &#39;Exponetial&#39;) # create a scatterplot, specifying hollow points &quot;b&quot; lines(x, y) # add a line between consecutive points } Negative Exponential A negative exponential function takes on the characteristics of \\(ae^{-bx}\\) a = 1 b = 0.5 x = seq(0,10,length = 100) y = a*exp(-b*x) plot.new() { plot(x,y, type = &#39;b&#39;, main = &#39;Negative Exponetial&#39;) lines(x, y) # add lines to the plot connecting the points } Saturating exponential growth function a = 1 b = 0.5 x = seq(0,10,length = 100) y = a*(1-exp(-b*x)) plot.new() { plot(x,y, type = &#39;b&#39;, main = &#39;Saturating Exponential Growth&#39;) lines(x, y) } Ricker Function A Ricker function takes on the characteristics of \\(axe^{bx}\\) or alternatively \\(N_t + 1 = N_t e^{r(1-N_t/K)}\\) and is commonly used in ecology and population modeling. It results in a bell shaped curve where \\(N_t\\) represents the population at time \\(t\\), \\(r\\) is the intrinsic growth rate, and \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity. a = 2 b = 0.5 x = seq(0,10,length = 100) y = a*x*exp(-b*x) plot.new() { plot(x,y, type = &#39;b&#39;, main = &#39;Ricker&#39;) lines(x, y) } What happens as the Ricker function approaches infinity? a = 1 b = 1 x = seq(0,10,length = 100) y = a*x*exp(-b*x) plot.new() { plot(x,y, type = &#39;b&#39;, main = &#39;Exponetial&#39;) lines(x, y) abline(lm(x~y)) } Michaelis-Menton Equation The Michaelis-Menton equation is commonly used in enzyme subjugation or predator-prey relationships, and takes on the form of \\(f(v) = V_max[S] / K_m + [S]\\). Here \\(v\\) indicates the rate velocity, \\(V_max\\) rpresents the maximum reaction rate when the enzyme is saturated, [S] indicates the substrate concentration, and \\(K_m\\) the Michaelis constant - the substrate concentration at which \\(V = V_max / 2\\). a = 1 b = 1 x = seq(0,10,length = 100) summary(x) ## Min. 1st Qu.

By definition it is non-deterministic, at least within the outline of our model. Thus the same input can lead to different outcomes. However, the probability of receiving a certain outcome within certain range can be calculated using probability, which is where what we know of as Probability distributions come from. This variability, or noise as it is often refered to, can be used to represent what we might expect to find in real world situations as it introduces noise to our deterministic models. For most scientists, noise is just a nuisance that gets in the way of drawing conclusions from the data. The traditional approach is to just assume all variation is normally distributed, or transform the data until it is to allow us to use traditional statistical methods to draw conclusions from the data. Noise affects ecological data in two different ways. The first is measurement error, or the variability or noise associated with the accuracy and specificity of our measurement technique. Big measurement error makes it difficult to estimate parameters and make inference from our data, as it leads to large confidence intervals and lowers statistical power. Process noise is the natural variability that arises from the system, and isn’t so much error as it is the result of the influence of unmeasured variables in the system. Below we will explore several common probability distributions usefull for statistics. 2.6.1 Probability Distributions Normal The normal or more correctly, gaussian distribution is the most commonly employed distribution. \\(z\\) takes on Continuously distributed quantities that can take on positive or negative values. Sums of things are normally distributed. z = rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 1) par(mfrow = c(1,2)) hist(z, main = &#39;Normal&#39;) plot(density(z), main = &#39;Density normal&#39;) #### Lognormal {-} Continously distributed with positive values. Random variables that have the property that their logs are normally distributed. Thus if \\(z\\) is normally distributed then the \\(exp(z)\\) is lognormally distributed. Products of things are normally distributed. z = rlnorm(1000, meanlog = 0, sdlog = 1) par(mfrow = c(1,2)) hist(z, main = &#39;lognormal&#39;) plot(density(z), main = &#39;Density lognormal&#39;) #### Gamma {-} The time required for a specified number of events to occur in a Poisson process. Any continuous quantity that is nonnegative. z = rgamma(n=1000, shape = 1, rate = 1) par(mfrow = c(1,2)) hist(z, main = &#39;gamma&#39;) plot(density(z), main = &#39;Density gamma&#39;) Uniform The uniform distribution takes on any real number, typically bounded by an upper and a lower boundary where any number in between is equally probable. z = runif(n=1000,min = -1,max = 1) par(mfrow = c(1,2)) hist(z, main = &#39;uniform&#39;) plot(density(z), main = &#39;Density uniform&#39;) Poisson Counts of things taht occur randomly over space and time i.e. the number of birds in a forest stand, the number of fish in a kilometer of river, the number of prey captured per minute. z = rpois(n = 1000, lambda = 10) par(mfrow = c(1,2)) hist(z, main = &#39;Poisson&#39;) plot(density(z), main = &#39;Density poisson&#39;) 2.6.2 Stoichastity in functions Randomness is typically predictable within biological systems, and we can add that to our functions expressed above to more closely approximate what we expect to observe in real life. Below we show an example using a simple linear model. First order quadratic set.seed(1) # Ensures our code returns the same random values each time x = runif(n = 100, min = 0, max = 12) # Independent X parameter placed on the X axis b0 = 10 # Specify the Y intercept b1 = 3 # Specify the B1 coefficient i.e. the slope r = rnorm(length(x), mean = 0, sd = 5) y = b0 + b1*x + r par(mfrow = c(1,5)) hist(x) hist(y) hist(r) plot(x,y, ylim = c(0,max(y)), main = expression(y == beta*0 + beta*1*x + epsilon)) abline(lm(y~x), col = &#39;blue&#39;) m = lm(y~x) hist(residuals(m)) summary(lm(y~x)) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = y ~ x) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -9.2489 -2.8111 -0.4353 2.6214 12.5830 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Rather, due to the controlled but intentionally introduced error and random variation in the data, the fit has changed and the intercept, and slope have all been affected. However, they may not be that different. Consider how this relates to our perception of truth, and expectations on the underlying systems has discussed in Module 1. 2.7 Homework and Review Questions What do the box and whiskers in a boxplot represent? (hint: use the help(boxplot) to help answer) What is your favorite between the box and whisker plot? What is something you noticed about the effect of pre and post supplemenation on the heifers? Copy and paste the code into your console, and turn in one plot of each kind covered today. What are some common applications for each of the deterministic functions described above?

Studying complex systems with high levels of natural variability requires utilization of statistics to infer pattern and causation from data. 3.1 Null Hypothesis Testing Null Hypothesis Significance Testing has been extensively used to make inference and test hypothesis (stephensInferenceEcologyEvolution2007?), but has also experienced extensive criticism due to the logical fallacies associated with the assumptions required to make inference regarding test statistics (hagenPraiseNullHypothesis?; sedgwickTrialsTribulationsTeaching?; wuThereIntrinsicLogical2018?). Whichever side of the fence you fall on, you should be aware of both the arguments for and against the utilization of NHST and by extension p-values in making scientific inference. After extensive reading, I will give you my anedotal opionion as of today (09/17/2025) of the issue. Whatever inferential paradigm you choose to use for your research is warranted providing you understand the underlying assumptions the statistical test makes, and exactly what each test statistic is testing (hagenPraiseNullHypothesis?; wassersteinASAStatementValues2016?). The most common critique of NHST that I have observed is that scientists and statisticians are not trained how to use tests appropriately, resulting in errant results being reported (hagenPraiseNullHypothesis?; ioannidisWhyMostPublished2005?). The magnitude of statistical tests designed for numerous experimental frameworks lend to the problem. Scientists without formal training in the choice of statistical tests are often highly motivated to find significant results, that is, to reject som \\(H_o\\) hypothesis in support of the \\(H_A\\). This motivation is counter to the primary motivation of NHST, which is to reject the \\(H_o\\) with trepidation (perezgonzalezFisherNeymanPearsonNHST2015?). This encourages researchers to go in search of significant results by utilizing any number of seemingly plausible available methods to obtain results which we find either either interesting, plausible, personally gratifying, or worse, important for the success of our career. However, whether made through ignorance or malice, that fact that we may report erroneous research results, and that most research results which we may build our research careers on are false (ioannidisWhyMostPublished2005?), should give us at least momentary pause. Due to the magnitude of potential scientific tests, which fill tomes of literature and giant volumes of books, teaching standardized statistics which seek to make inference of population central values and affirm or nullify \\(H_o\\) is extremely difficult task to undertake in the limited time we have here. Add in the conflation of posterior and apriori tests, and the conflation of the two, along with nonparametric and parametric tests, creating a clear picture of statistical analysis becomes difficult. So what should we do? I believe the answer rests in the application of two first principles. The first is to hold yourself to the highest set of moral ideals, seeking to reinforce your research findings through severe critique of the results by testing their endurance through multiple tests and alignment with quality research (mayoStatisticalInferenceSevere2018?). Secondly and of equal importance is to put in serious effort to read and understand the machinery of statistical tests and their underlying assumptions to ensure that the hypothesis you’re testing is the inference they are making (wuThereIntrinsicLogical2018?). 3.1.1 Population central values Making inference about a population is the foundation of beginning a good statistical analysis, and often starts in the exploratory analysis we began to explore in chapter 2. A population takes on numerical descriptive values known as parameters. Typical parameters of a population is the mean (\\(u\\)), median (M), standard deviation (\\(σ\\)), and proportion (\\(π\\)) (Ott and Longnecker 2016). For the purposes of hypothesis testing, we will make inference of these parameters in one of two ways. First is to estimate the value of the population, or we will test a hypothesis. The 95% confidence interval is the calculated interval over which 95% of the data will fall given a normal distribution around the central value, \\(u\\) in this case. The 95% confidence interval can be retrieved using the quantile function in R, or calculated using the equation of \\(u ± 1.96σ/√n\\). Here is an example of creating a population with known values of: N 10000 population size mean of 0 standard deviation of 1 n = 10000 # Population size u = 0 # population mean or central value sd = 1 # Standard deviation x = rnorm(100000, mean = u, sd = sd) x.den = density(x) # 95% confidence interval time q0.025 = quantile(x, 0.025) q0.975 = quantile(x, 0.975) # Identify x-values within the 95% CI x.ci &lt;- x.den$x[x.den$x &gt;= q0.025 &amp; x.den$x &lt;= q0.975] y.ci &lt;- x.den$y[x.den$x &gt;= q0.025 &amp; x.den$x &lt;= q0.975] { plot(x.den) # Add shaded polygon for 95% CI polygon(c(x.ci[1], x.ci, x.ci[length(x.ci)]), c(0, y.ci, 0), col = &#39;lightblue&#39;, border = NA) abline(v = c(mean(x)-sd(x),mean(x), mean(x)+sd(x)), col = c(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;red&#39;,&#39;blue&#39;)) legend(&quot;topright&quot;, legend = c(&#39;mean&#39;,&#39;standard deviation&#39;, &#39;95% CI&#39;), col = c(&quot;red&quot;,&#39;blue&#39;,NA), fill = c(NA,NA,&#39;lightblue&#39;), border = NA, lty = c(1,1,NA), lwd = c(2,2,NA), seg.len = 3, bty = &quot;n&quot;) } Now lets do that in one of our example datasets. library(qthink) data(&quot;bodyweight&quot;) x = bodyweight$BW0 x.den = density(x) # 95% confidence interval time q0.025 = quantile(x, 0.025) q0.975 = quantile(x, 0.975) # Identify x-values within the 95% CI x.ci &lt;- x.den$x[x.den$x &gt;= q0.025 &amp; x.den$x &lt;= q0.975] y.ci &lt;- x.den$y[x.den$x &gt;= q0.025 &amp; x.den$x &lt;= q0.975] par(mfrow = c(1,2)) { hist(x) plot(x.den) # Add shaded polygon for 95% CI polygon(c(x.ci[1], x.ci, x.ci[length(x.ci)]), c(0, y.ci, 0), col = &#39;lightblue&#39;, border = NA) abline(v = c(mean(x)-sd(x),mean(x), mean(x)+sd(x)), col = c(&#39;blue&#39;,&#39;red&#39;,&#39;blue&#39;)) # legend(&quot;topright&quot;, # legend = c(&#39;mean&#39;,&#39;standard deviation&#39;, &#39;95% CI&#39;), # col = c(&quot;red&quot;,&#39;blue&#39;,NA), # fill = c(NA,NA,&#39;lightblue&#39;), # border = NA, # lty = c(1,1,NA), # lwd = c(2,2,NA), # seg.len = 1, # bty = &quot;n&quot;) } Here we see a the same values of our population of bodyweights on day 0 from our heifers. Note how they do not follow the neat normal distribution, but do approximate it closely enough, at least visually. Here arises one of the first critiques of NHST that all tests assume that the population distribution follows a normal bell curve if enough samples are taken. Sample size This begs the question, how many samples are necessary to make inference of a populations central value? Here lies one of the first critiques of NHST, as we must assume that the overall greater population follows some known distribution, in this case, a normal distribution, and that we are sampling from that population. However, the greater population is actually unknowable outside of simply measuring the entire population. Samples are expensive, so at some point we have to simply accept that we have sampled enough, which is to say done our due diligence to collect an adequate representation of the greater population so we can make inference from it. Below we can show mathematically how many samples are required. The goal of sampling is to create a credible interval which has a given chance of containing \\(u\\), or the population mean. This reasonable level of certainty is typically set at 90-95% due to tradition. However, this runs two risks. 1) 95% levels of confidence means you run a 1 in 20 chance of not capturing the population mean. Equate this to having a 20 round magazine clip loaded into a gun that you are taking on a camping trip to the Little Bighorns in Wyoming for protection against Grizzly bears, in which 1 of the 20 bullets is a blank. Is this a risk you ar willing to take? The second risk is the inverse of the first, which is that this may be an unreasonble and arbritarily high level of confidence that would reduce the percieved validity of aquired data, particularly if the data is novel, but funds or circumstances meant obtaining enough samples to obtain this level of confidence was not possible, and thus the research was not conducted or the findings not reported. The formula is as follows: \\(n = (z_σ/2)^2^ σ^2^ / E^2^\\) and in code for the heifer bodyweight on day 0 Because the heifers range from 364, 638, the typical assumption to approximate the population \\(σ\\) is to take 68.5, and we might arbritrarily choose our accuracy to be 25 lbs. x = bodyweight$BW0 sigma = diff(range(x))/4 E = 25 n = (1.96^2 * sigma^2)/E^2 n ## [1] 28.8412 So, from this we can interpret that in order to quantify the central limit (\\(u\\)), of the population of heifers within 25 lbs with 95% confidence, we need 28 heifers. Now note how this changes as we tighten our accuracy levels. E = seq(50,1,-1) sigma = diff(range(x))/4 n = c() for (i in E) { n[i] = (1.96^2 * sigma^2)/E[i]^2 } { par(mfrow = c(1,2)) plot(E,n, type = &#39;n&#39;) points(E,n) lines(E,n, col = &#39;blue&#39;, lwd = 2) plot(E,n, xlim = c(5,length(E)), ylim = c(0,500)) lines(E,n, col = &#39;blue&#39;) } So we see that the desired level of accuracy of our measurement is directly related to the number of samples we have to take. The other parameter, which I would remind you we are making using prior assumptions, is the natural variation which exists in the greater population. How does that vary our sample size at a given level of accuracy? E = 25 # accuracy level sigma = seq(1,100,1) n = c() for (i in 1:length(sigma)) { n[i] = (1.96^2 * sigma[i]^2)/E^2 } { plot(sigma,n, type = &#39;n&#39;) points(sigma,n) lines(sigma,n, col = &#39;blue&#39;, lwd = 2) } So here we see that holding accuracy constant and varying the theorized population variance, we dramatically impact the required number of samples we have to take. Statistical test for u The statistical test takes on the concept of proof by contradiction, aka, NHST and is comprised of 5 parts. Null hypothesis \\(H_o\\) Research hypothesis \\(H_a\\) Test statistics Rejection region Check assumptions and draw conclusions The question is if our current measured value is greater than previously measured values. Suppose that \\(u_o\\) = 520 representing the combined mean from previous years of measurements \\(u\\) = 550 representing the mean from the current year We are testing the following if $H_a: u &gt; 320 $ negates the \\(H_o: u&lt;= 320\\). We then have to define the rejection region, and determine if \\(u\\) falls in the rejection region assuming that \\(H_o\\) is true. n = 36 uo = 520 # Mean from previous measurements u = 550 # Current mean from this year sd = 124 sigma = sd/sqrt(n) x0 = rnorm(n, mean = uo, sd = sd) q025 = quantile(x0, 0.025) q975 = quantile(x0, 0.975) x0.den = density(x0) # Identify x-values within the 95% CI x.ci &lt;- x0.den$x[x0.den$x &gt;= q025 &amp;

"],["demonstrating-equivalence.html", "Chapter 4 Demonstrating Equivalence", " Chapter 4 Demonstrating Equivalence I do have some concerns with the message that is conveyed by the title and approach taken in the statistical methods. Specifically, remember the definition of a p-value is “the probability of obtaining a value of the test statistic that is as likely or more likely to reject the null hypothesis (H0) as the actual observed value of the test statistic, assuming the null hypothesis is true.” The null hypothesis tested by a general linear mixed effects model for your study is generally “Newly weaned calves limit fed a high concentrate diet perform does not alter growth, performance, and efficiency compared to calves fed an ad libitum forage based diet”, with H0: ALF = LFC and HA: ALF ≠ LFC. A high p-value in this instance indicates a failure to reject the null hypothesis. No matter how large the p-value may be, it does not provide support for the null hypothesis. Failure to reject the null hypothesis means one must now become concerned with the power, or n, of the study, and then move forward to show sufficient effort was made to demonstrate equivalence, or conversely find differences, between treatments. This is typically illustrated by determining an acceptable delta, (difference between treatment) and then conducting a power analysis to show how many animals would be required to obtain a significant p-value at that acceptable delta given the variation in the system. If this is unnecessarily restrictive or feels difficult to communicate, more studies are moving towards a more Bayesian type of approach, which allows you to specify the prior distribution of the effect size (informed by what is biologically or economically relevant) and then calculate the likelihood of observing no meaningful effect.
