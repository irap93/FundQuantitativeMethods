	abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the differences in feeding behavior patterns of steers with divergent phenotypes for residual feed intake (RFI). Three trials were conducted with 508 Angus-based composite crossbred steers (body weight [BW] = 309 ± 57 kg) fed a high-concentrate diet in pens equipped with electronic feed bunks (GrowSafe System). Initial and final carcass ultrasound measurements (intra-muscular fat, backfat depth, and rib-eye area) were collected on days 0 and 70, and BW measured at 14-d intervals. Individual dry matter intake (DMI) and feeding behavior traits were collected for 70 d, and RFI calculated as the residual from the regression of DMI on average daily gain (ADG) and mid-test BW0.75. Steers were ranked by RFI and assigned to low-, medium-, and high-RFI classes based on ± 0.5 SD from the mean RFI within the trial. The feeding behavior traits evaluated in this study included frequency and duration of bunk visit (BV) and meal events, head-down (HD) duration, mean meal length, time-to-bunk interval, the maximum nonfeeding interval, and the day-to-day variation of these traits, defined as the root mean squared error (RMSE) from linear regression of each trait on the day of trial. Additionally, three ratio traits were evaluated: BV events per meal, HD duration per BV event, and HD duration per meal event. Low-RFI (feed-efficient) steers consumed 16\% less (P {\textless} 0.01) DMI, while BW and ADG were not different compared with high-RFI steers. Low-RFI steers had 18\% fewer and 21\% shorter (P {\textless} 0.01) BV events, and 11\% fewer and 13\% shorter (P {\textless} 0.01) meal events per day compared with high-RFI steers. Furthermore, low-RFI steers exhibited less (P {\textless} 0.05) day-to-day variance in DMI, as well as in frequency and duration of BV and meal events and HD duration compared with high-RFI steers. Differences in feeding behavior traits due to RFI were minimally affected by covariate adjustment for DMI, indicating that steers with divergent RFI have distinct feeding behavior patterns that are largely independent of differences in DMI. These results suggest that feeding behavior traits may be useful biomarkers for the prediction of feed efficiency in beef cattle.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Crossbred beef steers (n = 240; 12 pens/treatment; initial BW = 305 ± 17.7 kg) were used in a randomized block design feedlot study to evaluate the influence of coated trenbolone acetate (TBA) and estradiol-17β (E2) implants (Merck Animal Health, Madison, NJ) on gain performance, carcass traits, and sera metabolites. The five treatments were no implant (NI), Revalor-XR on d 0 [200 mg TBA + 20 mg E2 (coated); XR], Revalor-XS on d 0 [200 mg TBA + 40 mg E 2 (total): 80 mg TBA + 16 mg E2 (noncoated) and 120 mg TBA + 24 mg E2 (coated); XS], Revalor-200 on d 0 [200 mg TBA + 20 mg E2 (noncoated); E200], or Revalor-200 on d 70 (D200). Interim BW and blood were collected on d 0, 14, 35, 70, 105, 140, and 175 prior to feeding and on d 213 prior to shipping. Following a 24 h clot at 4 °C, sera was harvested to quantify circulating E2, IGF-I, NEFA, serum urea-N (SUN), and 17β-trenbolone (17β-TbOH). Implanted steers had greater (P ≤ 0.05) ADG, G:F, and final BW than NI controls. Implants increased (P {\textless} 0.05) HCW by 8\%, 366 vs. 391, 414, 380, and 396 ± 6.4 kg, for NI vs. XR, XS, E200, and D200, respectively. The greatest (P ≤ 0.05) dressing percentage, yield grade, and calculated empty body fat occurred in XS, which had greater (P {\textless} 0.05) rib fat than NI, XR, and D200. Marbling scores in NI were greater (P {\textless} 0.05) than E200 and D200; steers in XR and XS were intermediate (P {\textgreater} 0.10), not differing from NI, E200, or D200. An implant × day interaction (P ≤ 0.01) was noted for circulating E2, IGF-I, SUN, and 17β-TbOH. Implanted steers had elevated (P ≤ 0.05) sera E2, IGF-I, and 17β-TbOH, and decreased (P {\textless} 0.05) SUN following implantation compared to NI controls. Serum NEFA differed (P {\textless} 0.01) over time, but did not differ (P {\textgreater} 0.10) due to implant treatment. These data indicated that the polymer coating applied to the XR implant delayed release of steroidal hormones congruently to D200, with no negative impact on marbling. The greatest dose of E2, contained in XS, provided improvements in gain and carcass weight without detriment to marbling scores compared to NI.},

We examine research on ethical, legal and social issues in the life sciences (“ELSI”) and discuss three illustrative examples of normative issues that arise in different areas of the life sciences. These examples show that important normative questions are highly dependent on epistemic issues which so far have not been addressed sufficiently in ELSI, RRI and related areas of research. Accordingly, we argue for the integration of research on the epistemic aspects of the relevant areas of science into ELSI research to provide a better basis for addressing normative questions.},

@article{lindleyPhilosophyStatistics,
	title = {The {Philosophy} of {Statistics}},
	abstract = {This paper puts forward an overall view of statistics. It is argued that statistics is the study of uncertainty. The many demonstrations that uncertainties can only combine according to the rules of the probability calculus are summarized. The conclusion is that statistical inference is firmly based on probability alone. Progress is therefore dependent on the construction of a probability model; methods for doing this are considered. It is argued that the probabilities are personal. The roles of likelihood and exchangeability are explained. Inference is only of value if it can be used, so the extension to decision analysis, incorporating utility, is related to risk and to the use of statistics in science and law. The paper has been written in the hope that it will be intelligible to all who are interested in statistics.},

	abstract = {Mineral requirements are poorly described for most wildlife. Consequently, the role of forage minerals in movement and productivity are poorly understood for sedentary and migratory ungulates, such as reindeer and caribou (Rangifer tarandus). We applied estimates of maintenance, lactation, body mass change, and antler growth to production curves (body mass, daily intake, and milk yield) for female caribou to calculate their mineral requirements over summer. The total requirements (mg or g·d−1) were divided by the daily intake (kg·d−1) to estimate the minimum concentration of minerals required in the diet (mg or g·kg−1) to balance demand. The daily requirements (mg·d−1) of all minerals increased from parturition to the end of summer. The minimum dietary concentrations (mg·kg−1) of macro-minerals (Ca, P, Mg, Na, K) declined as food intake (kg·d−1) increased over summer. The minimum dietary concentrations (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn) were heavily influenced by body mass gain, which increased through late lactation even though food intakes rose. Our modeling framework can be applied to other wild ungulates to assess the impacts of changing forage phenology, plant community compositions, or environmental disturbances on movement and productivity.},

	abstract = {Protein is the first-limiting nutrient in cattle production worldwide. Urea and other non-protein nitrogen (NPN) compounds, which can be hydrolyzed to ammonia, can be used to replace natural protein in cattle diets. Ammonia is the common denominator when the mode of action is determined for NPN compounds. A stepwise presentation of the hydrolysis and use of urea to produce microbial protein is used as an example of ammonia utilization. Urea is a widely used NPN compound; thus, factors which affect urea utilization were discussed as follows: 1) Level and solubility of dietary protein; 2) Kind of dietary carbohydrate; 3) Level of dietary fat; 4) Adequacy of dietary minerals and vitamins and presence of antibiotics and diethylstilbestrol; 5) The effect of rate and frequency of feeding. The practiced usage of urea in beef and dairy cattle nutrition is discussed, with emphasis on ration conditions which promote urea utilization. It was pointed out that urea, when fed at too high a level, will cause ammonia toxicity in cattle. Urea toxicosis is rapid and acute, but present experimental evidence does not support the idea that urea causes chromic toxicity in cattle. The clinical course of urea toxicity is described and suggestions for possible treatments were made. Oral administration of five to ten gallons of cold water appears to be one of the best treatments and reasons for its beneficial effects were discussed. There does not appear to be any effect of “near toxic” levels upon the incidences of abortions or upon the subsequent reproductive performance of cows which survive urea over-dosage. The common misconceptions of veterinarians and livestock producers were considered and discussed. Also, the uses of biuret, ammonium sales and ammoniated products were discussed.},
